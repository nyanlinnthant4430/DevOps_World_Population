***Code of Conduct — Population Reporting System***
Purpose
This Code of Conduct sets clear expectations for teamwork, communication, and academic integrity in the Population Reporting System project. It ensures that all members work respectfully, fairly, and responsibly to achieve successful project outcomes.

Team Members

This code applies to all students working on the project, the tutor and any teaching assistants. Every member must follow these rules throughout the project.

Behaviour and Communication

Team members must be respectful, punctual, and supportive. Communication should be professional and clear. Telegram is used for daily updates, and Discord is used for meetings and discussions. All members should reply to messages within a reasonable time and attend scheduled meetings.

Responsibilities

Each member has specific tasks such as project coordination, technical development, data analysis, frontend design, or documentation. Everyone must complete their work on time, help others when needed, and keep the tutor informed about progress or problems.

Work Practices

Development is done using IntelliJ IDEA with GitHub for version control and Docker for testing. All changes should be made in branches and reviewed before merging into the main branch. The main branch must always remain stable.

Academic Integrity

Plagiarism is strictly forbidden. Members must cite any external code, data or tutorials used. All work must be original and honestly contributed. Any outside help should be acknowledged in the final report.

Data and Privacy

Only approved datasets may be used. No personal or private data should be exposed or shared. Reports should show only safe, aggregated information.

Deadlines and Contributions

Each task must have a clear owner and deadline. If someone cannot finish on time, they should inform the group at least two days before. A simple log should track who completed each task for fairness and grading.

Conflict and Consequences

Team issues should first be discussed calmly within the group. If not resolved, the project lead or tutor should be informed. Minor issues will get a warning, but serious or repeated problems (like plagiarism or non-cooperation) may lead to academic penalties.

Agreement

By joining this project, all members agree to follow this Code of Conduct and to work together with respect, honesty, and commitment.
